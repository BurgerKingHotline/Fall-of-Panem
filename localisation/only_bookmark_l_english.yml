 CAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Capitol stands as the ruler of Panem, its citizens living in luxury as those who live in the Districts toil away in servitude to the Capitol. It will do whatever it can to make sure its stranglehold on power continues, for failure could lead to the destruction of the entirety of Panem."
 NCL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Destruction of District 13 in the Dark Days is a well-known story throughout Panem. And it's a lie. During the Rebellion 74 years ago, after the tide had turned against the Rebels, District 13 threatened the Capitol with mutually assured destruction, and managed to gain their freedom, while the Capitol told all others that they were destroyed during the war."
