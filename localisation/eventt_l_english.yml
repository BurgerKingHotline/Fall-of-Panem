 district.1.t:0 "Districts Request Permission to Mobilize"
 district.1.d:0 "With raising tensions and instability has come uncertainty and a push for more militarization within the districts, wanting to be able to defend themselves. But they may have other, more nefarious motives with this request. We must be careful."
 district.1.a:0 "We cannot risk our subjects becoming too powerful"
 district.1.b:0 "Our Districts must be able to defend themselves"
 district.2.t:0 "The Capitol Denies Our Military Request"
 district.2.d:0 "Due to ignorance, paranoia, arrogance, or just wanting to demonstrate their power over us, the Capitol has denied our request, weakening our hold on the populace as they realize we aren't allowed to strengthen our forces."
 district.2.a:0 "Guess we'll just have to make do"
 district.3.t:0 "The Capitol Accepts Our Military Request"
 district.3.d:0 "We are now able to mobilize more troops and increase militarization thanks to the Capitol understanding our need for it."
 district.3.a:0 "Glory to Panem!"
 district.4.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] asks to join our alliance"
 district.4.d:0 "One of the Districts has broken free from the Capitol and requests our aid in the war against it, and we must decide whether to stand together or leave them to their fate."
 district.4.a:0 "Bring them into the fold!"
 district.4.b:0 "They can fight on their own"
 district.5.t:0 "Explosion at the Hunger Games!"
 district.5.d:0 "Shock filled the spectators of the 75th Hunger Games as an explosion rocked the shield surrounding the arena, creating an opening that a few rebel-aligned Tributes took advantage of to flee. This has thrown the Game into chaos, with several other Tributes finding the hole and fighting over who got to escape before Peacekeepers managed to come in and secure the surviving Tributes, transporting them to the Capitol for temporary holding while we sort out the chaos. Search parties are currently looking for the rebel-aligned escapees, but it seems like they may have managed a clean escape, shaming the search teams. Nothing like this has ever happened, but it seems like it might just be the beginning of a new time of chaos. Maybe even the start of a new Dark Days."
 district.5.a:0 "How could this have happened?"
 district.6.t:0 "The Capitol Demands More Resources"
 district.6.d:0 "Recently the Capitol has become more decadent and demanding, and is putting the pressure on its districts to provide for their excess. This has disgruntled some of the populace, leading to grumblings of rebellion growing within our borders."
 district.6.a:0 "The Capitol will get their resources, for now"
 district.7.t:0 "The Capitol Expands Peacekeeping Programs"
 district.7.d:0 "Beginning to become suspicious of their subjects, the Capitol has called for increased Peacekeeper Duties, demanding that those who seek to overthrow them be caught before they can do any damage. This will, however, strain some of our resources."
 district.7.a:0 "As the Capitol Demands, so we shall follow"
